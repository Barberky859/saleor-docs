During the installation, Saleor will register the app based on its [manifest](developer/extending/apps/architecture/manifest.mdx). Besides some basic information, the manifest also includes a list of [permissions](developer/permissions.mdx#app-permissions) and a [subscription webhook payload](/developer/extending/webhooks/subscription-webhook-payloads.mdx) that the app needs to work. If those fields change after the app installation, you must manually update the app.
