## Deleting attribute

If you are deleting an attribute, it will affect the following:

- Variant selection will lose the mapping.

- Attribute data assigned to products and content will be lost

- Types will no longer have the attribute.

Note that Saleor does not prevent you from deleting an attribute in use. It is up to the developer to ensure that the attribute is not in use before deleting it.

**Tip:** If you are unsure if it is safe to delete the attribute, you can make it private to see if it has any negative effect.

## Marking as required

If the attribute is marked as required upon creation, the value must be filled in when creating a product or content block. If the attribute is marked as required after it has been used in products or content, it will only be required for the products created after the configuration change.

**Tip:** Because attribute values can be missing, it is a good idea to make your code resilient to missing values.
