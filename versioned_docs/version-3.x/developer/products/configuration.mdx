## Example steps

Let's recreate a sample T-shirt product in Saleor.
The product is T-shirt that comes in different sizes, where each size has a different price and length description.

<Figure src={tshirt} alt={`Example config`} />

1. In _Configuration -> Attributes_ Create following _Product Attributes_:

   1. Create _Size_ attribute:

      - Default label _Size_ which is the value that storefront can display to shoppers.
      - Attribute code _T-shirt Size_ this is internal name of the attribute for admins and developers to distinguish attributes.
      - Assign values _S, M, L, XL, XXL_
      - Select _Value is required_, which will ensure that sizes are always specified for each variant.
      - We want to make this attribute filterable and visible to shoppers, select _Use as filter_ and _Public_ checkboxes. [Learn more](developer/attributes/configuration.mdx).

   2. Create _Material_ attribute:
      - Default label _Material_ which is the value that storefront can display to shoppers.
      - Attribute code _material_text_ this is internal name of the attribute for admins and developers to distinguish attributes.
      - Select _Plain text_ as the type of the attribute, this would allow describing any material or fabric using text.
      - This value is optional, so it can be left empty when we will be creating the product.
   3. Create _Length_ attribute:
      - Default label _Length_ which is the value that storefront can display to shoppers.
      - Attribute code _length_cm_ this is internal name of the attribute for admins and developers to distinguish attributes.
      - Select _Numeric_ as the type of the attribute, for the unit choose _Metric_, _Distance_ and _Centimeter_.
      - This value is optional, so it can be left empty when we will be creating the product.

2. In _Configuration -> Product types_ Create a product type:

   1. Name the product type _T-shirt_.
   2. Assign product attribute **Material**
   3. On a variant level assign attribute **Size** and mark it as a _Variant selection_ which would indicate that attribute should be mapped to a variant.
   4. On a variant level add attribute **Length**
   5. Select _Shippable_ to require customers to provide shipping address when purchasing the product, for digital products this can be left unchecked.

3. Create category in _Products_ -> _Categories_ named _T-shirts_.

4. Creating the product:

   1. Create a product with a type _T-shirt_.
   2. Name the product _T-shirt with a print_.
   3. Assign the product to the category _T-shirts_.
   4. Type _Cotton_ in the _Material_ field.
   5. Save the product.
   6. Add variants S, M, L, XL, XXL. Each variant can be mapped to a "Size" attribute.
   7. To edit the length attribute, open the variant editor and fill in the length description.

5. Availability and channels:

   1. Assign the product to a channel in the Availability section.
   2. Set the product to Published and Available for purchase.
   3. After completing the steps above, the `Variants` section will allow you to `Turn on Availability` and `Price` for the respective channel.

### Availability

Channel availability can be controlled both on product and variant levels.
Variants can overwrite the product's availability settings, but if the channel is not available on the product level, it will not be available for any variant.

- Product level availability:
  1. Product can be assigned to channels, to make it visible to the storefront.
  2. Product can be set to `Published` or `Not published` to control visibility in Storefront, unlike the setting above.
