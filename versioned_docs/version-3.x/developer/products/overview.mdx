Products are the essential components of an order, and at least one product must exist to create a checkout or order. The table below outlines the business logic that products contain out of the box, but note this functionality can be opt-in or customized.

## Product and variants

Variants are designed to provide variations of the product, such as size, material, color, or any other dimension that can be user-defined; if the product has no variants, you will need to create a product with a single variant because prices and stock can only be assigned at a variant level.

It might seem like it is overhead to configure twice the availability of variant and product (especially when there is only one variant), but it has an intentional purpose. First, it gives more degree of freedom per variant, and second, it is convenient when you have many variants and need to disable one all at once in a single channel.

It is possible to create products without variants, but checkout and orders can only contain variants.

Variants give level of control of

| **Price**                | The price is set at the channel level, which can have a dedicated currency. Prices can be set as Selling Prices intended for customers and Cost Prices, which are optional and only used for internal purposes.                                                                | Customizable. It can be overwritten on checkout/order level.             |
| **Availability**         | Variants inherit the product's availability and allow a finer level of control. For example, if the product is available in 2 out of 3 channels, then variant availability will be available in respective 2 channels.                                                         | Required.                                                                |

| **Attributes**           | Variants have two types of attributes, standard attributes can hold any type of information and Selection Attributes which guarantee that attribute values are unique per each variant.                                                                                        |                                                                          |
| **Warehouse assignment** | Variants are mapped to unique SKU that can belong to multiple warehouses.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                          |
| **Media**                | Images are inherited from the product; for example, if the product has images A, B, and C, any product image can be assigned to a specific asset. This way, the product serves as summary of all product images and variant points to a specific image relevant to the variant | Optional.

## Product types

Product type is a collection of [attributes](developer/attributes/overview.mdx) which different types of fields. For example a _Product Type_ **T-shirt** will have **Size**, **Material** and **Length** attributes.

**Material:** can be _Cotton_ or _Polyester_ and would represent a dropdown attribute, that is assigned to a product type.

**Size:** of the shirt is a product option that can be selected by the customer, it comes with predefined sizes, so it will be type _Dropdown_ it would be a _Variant selection attribute_ [see more](#variant-selection-attributes).

**Length:** is attribute specific to a variant, but it is not something that customer can select, and it is unique to each product so it will be of type _Numeric_.
