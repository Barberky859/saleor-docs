### Product is not visible in the storefront

Follow this checklist if a product is not visible in the Storefront or API:

1. **Product is published**: Enable `Product is published` and `Available for purchase` for the respective channel. Depending on the storefront implementation, it might be necessary to disable `Hide in product listings`.
2. **Variant is enabled**: `Variant` is set to `Available`, and `Price` is set to higher than zero for the respective channel.
3. **Use correct channel slug**: When querying products, use the correct channel slug instead of channel names, which can contain uppercase letters and white space.

### Product can't be added to an order

Orders are channel-specific; ensure the product is available in the respective channel by following [these steps](#product-is-not-visible-in-the-storefront).

Availability of products depends on the customer's location; follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Find the `Shipping zone` that should be used for the customer's `Shipping` and `Billing` address.

- Shipping zone should have assigned `Country` matching customer address.
- The shipping zone should have assigned a `Channel` that matches the order's `Channel`.
- Shipping zone has at least one `Warehouse` enabled.

2. Check if at least one of the `Warehouses` of the shipping zone has stock. Only warehouses enabled in the shipping zone are considered for stock availability.
