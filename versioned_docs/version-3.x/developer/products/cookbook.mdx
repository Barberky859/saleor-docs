### Product bundles

There are many ways to create a product bundle. Here is an example of creating a product bundle with a discount.

- Create attribute `Bundle` of type `Product reference`.
- Create product type `Bundle` and assign the `Bundle` attribute.
- Create a product of type `Bundle` and link products in the `Bundle` attribute.
- In variant settings, remove "Track inventory"; stock must be calculated programmatically via API.
- Create a discount for the bundle.
- Swap the bundle with individual products During the order export to ERP.

### Custom price calculation

It is possible to overwrite the product price on the checkout level for configurators and other non-static price calculations.

### Linking products or creating recommendation

Here is an example of linking products to create a _Similar products_ feature.

1. In `Configuration` create an attribute `Similar products` of type `References` and `Entity`.
2. Assign the `Similar products` attribute to the desired `Product type` on the product level.
3. Products will now show `Similar fields` to link other products.
