## Deleting a product

Deleting the product will have an effect on the following:

- **Draft order:** the product will be removed from the draft order.
- **Checkout:** the product will be removed from the checkout.
- **Order data:** order lines will be preserved but the product photography will not be available.

## Changing availability

When a product in the **Checkout** or **Draft order** becomes unavailable, the order cannot be finalized.
