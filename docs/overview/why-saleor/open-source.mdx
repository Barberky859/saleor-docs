# Benefits of open-source

#### Transparency

Our codebase, roadmap, and development process are open to everyone.

#### Control

Our users own their data and can have full control over the platform even if they are using our cloud infrastructure.

#### Sustainable

Relying on close source vendors means your business is subject to policy changes, price changes, and even shutdowns.

#### Digital ethics

We respect user and customer privacy, being open allows anyone to examine that.

#### Ability to experiment

Running software locally enables developers to run, test, debug and experiment with data without any restrictions.

#### Security

Open source allows anyone to view, audit, and patch the code.
The security of the platform doesn't depend only on vendor's interest or the ability to hire dedicated security experts.

#### Community

Open source attracts enables us to build a thriving community of developers and advocates.

#### Educational

Users can learn about the platform beyond documentation and tutorials.

## Our approach to open source

#### We mean business

Our core, dashboard, apps, starter kits, docs, everything is open-source and has commercially unrestricted license.

#### Single version of the product

There is **no** _Enterprise edition_ or _Community edition_ core product.
We want to put the best tools in the hands of every business.

#### Centrally governed

We have a thriving open to contributions, but our project is employee driven with a centralized decision-making process
which provides predictable roadmap and have focused vision.
