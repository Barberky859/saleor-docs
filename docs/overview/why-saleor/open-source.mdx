## Benefits of open-source

#### Transparency

Our codebase, roadmap, and development process are open to everyone.

#### Control

Our users own their data and have control of the platform, even when using our cloud infrastructure.

#### Sustainable

Relying on closed-source vendors means your business is subject to policy changes, price changes, and even shutdowns.

#### Digital ethics

We respect user and customer privacy, and being open allows anyone to examine that.

#### Ability to experiment

Running software locally enables developers to run, test, debug, and experiment with data without restrictions.

#### Security

Open source allows anyone to view, audit, and patch the code.
Adherence to security is not contingent on the vendor's ability to hire dedicated engineers.

#### Community

Open source enables us to build a thriving community of developers and advocates.

#### Educational

Users can learn about the platform beyond documentation and tutorials.

## Our approach to open source

#### We mean business

Our core, dashboard, apps, starter kits, docs, everything is open-source and has commercially unrestricted license.

#### Single version of the product

There is **no** _Enterprise edition_ or _Community edition_ core product.
We want to put the best tools in the hands of every business.

#### Centrally governed

We have a thriving open to contributions, but our project is employee-driven with a centralized decision-making process
which provides a predictable roadmap and have focused vision.
