### API Only

• **Webhooks.** You can subscribe to more than a hundred [events](/developer/extending/webhooks/overview) to receive data from Saleor.

• **API extensions.** Saleor can [proxy](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/overview) calls to your service to modify behavior or resources.

• **Dashboard extensions.** [Extend admin](/developer/extending/apps/overview) functionality using any front-end stack embeddable into _iframes_.

• **Granular permission control.** [Granular permissions](/developer/permissions) for access tokens.

• **GraphQL oriented.** Provide GraphQL queries to shape the data provided via Webhooks.

### Why not plugin architecture?

Plugin architecture is popular among open-source projects, classical examples would be Magento or Shopify.
Such a model has direct coupling which the platform which can be convenient to get started quickly,
but can also lead to many issues.

**Benefits over plugin architecture:**

• **Technology agnostic.**
Technology stack freedom allowing you to pick the best tool for the job and access larger talent pool.

• **Improved security.** Tightly coupling creates security risks.

• **Independent deployment.** You can deploy your microservices independently.

• **Reliability.** Less risk of degrading performance or bringing the whole system down.

• **Scalability.** You can allocate resources more efficiently for your services.

• **Multi-market.** Plugin architecture provides less independence between teams and marketers, creating higher chance of interference.

• **Open Standards.**
By using GraphQL we are able to tap larger ecosystem of tools and community rather using limited proprietary SDKs.
