### API Only

• **Webhooks.** You can subscribe to more than hundred [events](/developer/extending/webhooks/overview) to recieve data from Saleor.

• **API extensions.** Saleor can [proxy](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/overview) calls to your service to modify behavior or resources

• **Dashboard extensions.** [Extend admin](/developer/extending/apps/overview) functionality using iframes

• **Granular permission control.** All admin actions are available via API using access tokens that can have [granular permissions](/developer/permissions)

• **GraphQL oriented.** You are able to use GraphQL queries to shape the data you want to recieve via Webhooks.

### Why not plugin architecture?

Plugin architectures are specially popular among open-open source projects, classical examples would be Magento or Shopify.
Such model has direct coupling which the platform which can be convenient to some, but can also lead to many issues.
In the early days Saleor was following such model, but it was quickly abandoned due many draw backs.

**Benefits over plugin architecture:**

• **Technology agnostic.** You have more freedom, larger talent pool and can pick the best technology for the job.

• **Improved security.** Tightly coupling imposes many security risks.

• **Independent deployment.** You can deploy your microservices independetly.

• **Reliability.** Less risk of degrading performance or bringing the whole system down.

• **Scalability.** You can allocate resources more efficiently for your services.

• **Multi-market.** If you work across different markets and teams most likely plugin architecture would create unecessary dependecy.

• **Open Standards.** By using GraphQL we are able to tap larger ecosystem of tools and community rather than building custom SDKs.
