Saleor provides flexible multichannel support,
where a channel can be a region, business model, brand, sales channel etc.
Data can be shared, isolated, or customized across different channels,
eliminating the need for multiple instances of backend.

**Why is it important?**

Multichannel design is a fundamental part of platform architecture, and it is not trivial to extend such functionality.
Even if your use case doesn't require multichannel support now, it can become a requirement in the future,
so it can be strategic to eliminate the risk of it becoming a bottleneck for your platform.

### Use cases

• Operating across different regions.

• Localization of content, pricing, and shipping.

• Permission management across different legal teams.

• Serving multiple business models (for example, B2B & B2C) from a single instance.

• Create multi-brand websites.

### Benefits over multi-instance

**Efficient operations.** Admins can operate from a single instance.

**Development workflow.** Developers can use single API instance which simplifies development and testing.

**Scalable.** No need to synchronize data between multiple instances.

**Faster time to market.** Launch new regions and business models quicker.

### Our approach

**Depth**. Every aspect of our platform designed with multichannel in mind.

**Dashboard native**. Dashboard is organized around multichannel operations, giving control to admins not only API.
