title: SaaS or Self-Host
---

## No vendor lock-in

SaaS model offers convenience to organizations at the cost of losing control.
We believe users should not choose between convenience or control.
Infrastructure needs can evolve over time,
we enable a straightforward migration path between Cloud and On-prem infrastructure.

### Benefits of our model:

- Cloud users own their data, making it possible to migrate to self-host.

- We are incentive to provide competitive SaaS service to self-host.

- Use hybrid approach to expand to marketers that have legal requirements to have on-prem hosting.

- Single version of Saleor. We don't discriminate platform features between free self-host, cloud or on-prem license.

- Developers can use both Cloud and local development workflows.
