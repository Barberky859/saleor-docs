# No vendor lock-in.

Typically SaaS model offer convenience to organizations at the cost of loosing control.
We believe users should not choose between convenience or control.

### Benefits of our model:

• We are incentive to provide good Cloud service.

• Single version of Saleor. We don't discriminate between community editions and enterprise.
