title: Composable
---

A composable architecture follows modular approach where external components can be combined and swapped.

For example you might want combine indepedent vendors of `Cotent managment`, `Checkout API` and `Order managment` that suits your business needs, commonly refered as _best-of-breed_ architecture.

### Difference from monolith

Monolith arhitectures have tightly coupled components creating friction or making imposible to integrate with other systems.
Even thouhg most so monolithic commerce platoforms do have integrations they often come with more limitations and inneficient implementations compared to composable systems.

Example of monolith limitations:

• Creation of order requires objects such as customers, products and its attributes need to be present in the system.

• Craetion of order follows rigit structure where status, date or order number can not be altered.

• Lack of external resources, for example shipping providers need to be defined upfront in the systems instead of being quried on demand.

• Price can not be calculated dynamically by using external service, custom logic needs to be included in the backend in form of a plugin or extension.

### Benefits of composable

• **Future proof.** As your business requirments evolve you can swap individual components with less effort compared to monolith.

• **Tech agnostic**. Teams can use any technology stack.

• **Global expansion**. Operating on multiple markets might require use of different components per each market.

• **Indepedent deployment**. You can upgrade individual components with less side effects.

### Our approach to composable

• **Batteries included.** Even though we believe in the best of breed philosophy, Saleor has strong focus on the operational experience of the dashboard.
We provide most essentials out of the box for global operations.

• **Balanced approach.** We strive to strike a balance between productivity and flexibility.
For example we provide opinionated product pricing model which aims to be useful for majority of busneses as is, but you are also free to take full control over your pricing logic.
