title: Composable
---

A composable architecture follows modular approach where external components components can be combined and swapped.

For example you might want combine indepedent vendors of `Cotent managment`, `Checkout API` and `Order managment` that suits your business needs, commonly refered as best-of-breed.

### Difference from monolith

Monolith arhitectures tight coupling between different components requiring more effort to integrate or swap components, if not possible at all.
Even thouhg most so called monolithic commerce platoforms have integrations they often come with more limitations compared to composable systems.

Example of monolith limitations:

• Creation of order requires objects such as customers, products and its attributes need to be present.

• Craetion of order follows rigit structure where status, date or order number can not be provided

• Lack of external resources, for example shipping providers need to be defined upfront in the systems.

• Price promotions can not be calculated dynamically by using external service, custom logic needs to be included in the backend in form of a plugin or extension.

### Benefits of composable

• **Future proof.** As your business requirments evolve you can swap individual components with less effort compared to monolith.

• **Tech agnostic**. Teams can use any technology stack.

• **Global expansion**. Operating on multiple markets might require use of different components per each market.

• **Cost control**. If one of the vendors becomes expensive you have easier access to alternatives.

• **Reliability**

• **Security**

• **Deployment**

### Our approach to composable

• **Batteries included.** Even though we believe in the best of breed philosophy, Saleor has strong focus on the operational experience of the dashboard.
Our goal to be useful to power essential operations of global brands out of the box.

• **Balanced approach.** We strive to strike a balance between being productivity and flexibility.
For example we provide opinionated product pricing model which aims to be useful for majority of busneses as is, but you are also free to take full control over your pricing logic.
