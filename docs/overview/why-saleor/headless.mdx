title: Headless
---

Headless architecture decouples front-end from backend,
meaning that backend only responds with data without presentation logic such as HTML.

### Key benefits

#### Use any front-end technology

You can consume backend data using any web, mobile or native technology.
This is specially useful when you have different platforms to serve such as kiosks,
point of sales, web, mobile, VR, etc.

#### Creative freedom

Decoupled backend provides more design freedom.

#### Front-end team independence

Front-end teams can make changes to the project without being dependent on backend.

#### Full control over performance

Headless setup gives more control over the performance of your applications.

## Our approach to headless

**Front-end ready API**

In some cases, Saleor API can be consumed directly by front-end applications without requiring middleware. Projects without _Backend For Frontend_ potentially enable faster development speed and reduces maintenance costs of your applications.

**GraphQL**

GraphQL in headless setup has performance and productivity advantages compared to _REST_. Read [Why GraphQL](graphql).

**Starter kits**

We provide tools to accelerate development and document best practices. Check out our [starter kits](/overview/resources).

**Admin extensions**

Admin is extensible using _iFrame_ approach, which allows you to use any web technology to extend it. Read more about [admin extensions](/extensions/overview).
