---

Headless arhitecture decouples front-end from backend, meaning that backend only responds with data without presentation logic such as HTML.

### Key benefits

#### Use any front-end technology

You can consume backend data using any web, mobile or native technology. This is specially useful when you have different platoforms to serve such as kiosks, point of sales, web, mobile, VR etc.

#### Creative freedom

Unapoinated backend gives more design freedom.

#### Front-end team independence

Front-end teams can make changes to the project without being dependent on backend.

#### Full control over performance

Headless setup gives more control over performance of your applications.

## Our approach to headless

• **Front-end oriented API.** Saleor goal is to minimize the amount of custom backend logic necessary between client.

• **GraphQL.** We believe that GraphQL makes headless implementation more approachable. Read [Why GraphQL](graphql)

• **Starter kits.** We provide tools to accelerate development and document best practices. Check out starter kits.
