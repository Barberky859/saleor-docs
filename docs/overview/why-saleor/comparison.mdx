title: Comparison to others
---

This comparison guide is mostly oritented for devs, if you wish to get assistance in business features comparison please reach out to sales.
If you find any innacuracies in comparisons please open [Github issue](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-docs/issues/new).

#### Why not compare business features?

Commerce platforms vary in scope and depth greatly, thats why we do not attempt to write such comparisons.
Each project is unique and requeres expert assistance to validate fit.

We like to draw analagy with comparing commerce platforms by business features matrix alone and using furniture as buying criteria for real estate,
it might be ueful if you want to move in tomorrow but not so useful as an investment criteria.
