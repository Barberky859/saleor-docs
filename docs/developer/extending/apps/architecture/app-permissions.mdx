title: App permissions
---

App permissions are defined on a per-app basis. Access can be assigned during the app installation and modified later using the [appUpdate](api-reference/apps/mutations/app-update.mdx) mutation.
The apps don't have channel restrictions, so all channels data can be visible by the app with the proper permission.

:::info

The user needs the `MANAGE_APPS` permission to display any app. To install, deactivate or delete an app, the user needs to have both the `MANAGE_APPS`, as well as all the same permissions as the app.

:::

To illustrate it, let's say you have a Tax App that requires the `HANDLE_TAXES` permission. You also have two permission groups: _Accountants_ and _Developers_. The accountants should be able to use the Tax App, but not delete or deactivate it. This is for the developers to handle. The permissions for these groups would look like this:

- Accountants: `MANAGE_APPS` (_needed to display the app_)
- Developers: `HANDLE_TAXES`, `MANAGE_APPS` (_needed to display the app, as well as to manage it_)
