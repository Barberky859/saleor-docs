During the installation, Saleor will register the app based on its [manifest](developer/extending/apps/architecture/manifest.mdx). Besides some basic information, the manifest also includes a list of [permissions](developer/permissions.mdx#app-permissions) and a [subscription webhook payload](/developer/extending/webhooks/subscription-webhook-payloads.mdx) that the app needs to work.

If those fields change after the app installation, you must update the app in Saleor API, as well as adjust the app's code to handle the new permissions and webhook payloads.

## Updating webhooks

:::info

The process of updating the webhooks is described in the [How to update app webhooks](developer/extending/apps/updating-app-webhooks.mdx) guide.
