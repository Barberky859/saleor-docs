title: Updating apps
---

During the installation, Saleor will register the app based on [the manifest](developer/extending/apps/architecture/manifest.mdx). Besides some basic information, a manifest also includes a list of [permissions](developer/permissions#app-permissions) and [subscription webhook payloads](developer/extending/webhooks/subscription-webhook-payloads.mdx) that the app needs to work. If those fields change after the app is already installed, you need to update the app manually.

## Updating permissions

- Describe that the app can start requiring a new permission with an update, and it needs to work correctly without this permission. The action that requires the permission will just fail.
- Describe that if the app requires a new permission, you can grant it through the [RequestPermissions](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/developing-apps/app-sdk/app-bridge#available-actions) action in the dashboard

## Updating webhooks

- Describe updating the webhooks through API. Refer to SDK code that can help with that.
