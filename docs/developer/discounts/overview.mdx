Discounts allow for the reduction of prices for selected variants, products, collections,
or categories by a given percentage or a fixed value. They can also decrease the value 
of subtotal and shipping price or grant a gift if certain conditions are met. 

## Classification

To better understand Saleor discounts and explain terms used in this documentation, let's classify discounts
by type, level and value type.

### Type
There are three kinds of discounts in Saleor: [`Promotions`](developer/discounts/promotions.mdx), 
[`Vouchers`](developer/discounts/vouchers.mdx) and [`Manual discounts`](developer/discounts/manual-discounts.mdx).
The **promotion** discount is automatically applied to all products included in the promotion,
without requiring any additional actions from the user.
In contrast, **voucher** requires the user to provide a code during the checkout process.
Lastly, Saleor offer **manual disocunts**, which can be applied by staff users.

* [`promotions`](developer/discounts/promotions.mdx)
    * [`catalogue promotion`](developer/discounts/promotions.mdx#catalogue-promotions)
    * [`order promotion`](developer/discounts/promotions.mdx#order-promotions)
* [`vouchers`](developer/discounts/vouchers.mdx)
    * [`entire order`](developer/discounts/vouchers.mdx#applying-the-entire-order-voucher)
    * [`specific product`](developer/discounts/vouchers.mdx#applying-the-specific-product-voucher)
    * [`vouchers with applyOncePerOrder=True`](developer/discounts/vouchers.mdx#applying-the-once-per-order-entire-order-voucher)
    * shipping
* manual discounts
    * [`manual order discount`](developer/discounts/manual-order-discount.mdx)
    * [`manual line discount`](developer/discounts/manual-line-discount.mdx)

### Level
We can distinguish discounts by the object they are accossiated with. 
Line-level discounts are applicable first, directly to the order line and they decrease the line base prices.
Order-level discounts are associated with an order object, they decrease subtotal or shipping price 
and next the discount is propagated to order's lines.

    * [`catalogue promotion`](developer/discounts/promotions.mdx#catalogue-promotions)
    * [`specific product vouchers`](developer/discounts/vouchers.mdx#applying-the-specific-product-voucher)
    * [`vouchers with applyOncePerOrder=True`](developer/discounts/vouchers.mdx#applying-the-once-per-order-entire-order-voucher) 
    * shipping voucher (despite being associated with an order, and not with order line, it decreases [shipping base price](developer/price-calculation.mdx#base-price), so can be considered as line-level disocunt)
    * [`manual line discount`](developer/discounts/manual-line-discount.mdx)

* order-level discounts
    * [`order promotion`](developer/discounts/promotions.mdx#order-promotions)
    * [`entire order voucher`](developer/discounts/vouchers.mdx#applying-the-entire-order-voucher)
    * [`manual order discount`](developer/discounts/manual-order-discount.mdx)
    

### Value Type
In general, discounts can take two forms:
* `fixed` - fixed amount, that is deducted from the original price
* `percentage` - percentage value of the original price
