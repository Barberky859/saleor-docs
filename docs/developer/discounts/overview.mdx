Discounts allow for the reduction of prices for selected variants, products, collections,
or categories by a given percentage or a fixed value. They can also decrease the value 
of subtotal and shipping price or grant a gift if certain conditions are met. 

## Classification

To better understand Saleor discounts and explain terms used in this documentation, let's classify discounts
by type, level and value type.

### Type
There are three kinds of discounts in Saleor: [`Promotions`](./promotions.mdx), [`Vouchers`](./vouchers.mdx)
and `Manual discounts`.
The **promotion** discount is automatically applied to all products included in the promotion,
without requiring any additional actions from the user.
In contrast, **voucher** requires the user to provide a code during the checkout process.
Lastly, Saleor offer **manual disocunts**, which can be applied by staff users.
