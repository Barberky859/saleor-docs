## Introduction
Manual discounts can be applied by staff users to orders with `DRAFT` or `UNCONFIRMED` status.
The discount can't be combined and overrides all the others discounts applied to the same object.
The discount can be applied to the order, decreasing its subtotal and shipping price, or to the order line,
reducing its unit price.

### Manual order discount
The manual order discount can be applied with [`orderDiscountAdd`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-discount-add.mdx) mutation.
It affects both subtotal and shipping price. When the order qualify for order promotion or has entire order voucher applied, 
the manual order discount takes precedence and override them. The basis for the calculation are [base subtotal](developer/price-calculation.mdx#discount-application) 
and [base shipping] prices(developer/price-calculation.mdx#discount-application), meaning [line-level](developer/discounts/overview.mdx#level) discounts are not overriden. 

#### Example


### Manual line discount
The manual line discount can be applied with [`orderLineDiscountUpdate`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-line-discount-update.mdx) mutation.
It cuts unit price of the order line. The basis for the discount is undiscounted unit price, meaning any other unit price reductions like catalogue promotions or
specific product vouchers are overridden.
