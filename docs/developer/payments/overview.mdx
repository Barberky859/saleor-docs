## Introduction

The process below describes the key milestones in the Saleor payment flow.
Additional steps may also occur along the way; however, the purpose of this instruction is to
deliver a base reference for the user to work with.

Saleor distinguishes two different approaches to processing payments:

- By using a [Payment App](#payment-app).
- By using a [Custom App](#custom-app).
- By using a [Plugin](developer/extending/plugins/overview.mdx) embedded in the Saleor code (legacy).

:::note

If you're considering building a custom payment integration, please check if the payment provider you're interested in isn't already available [Saleor App Store](developer/app-store/apps/overview.mdx#built-in-apps-catalog).

## Comparison of Payment Apps and Custom Apps

|                        | Payment Apps                                                                                          | Custom Apps                                                                   |

| Users communicate with | Saleor GraphQL API                                                                                    | The app directly                                                              |
| Consistency            | The same set of queries and mutations for each Payment App                                            | Different APIs depending on the custom app implementation                     |
| Transactions           | Created automatically by Saleor based on requests to payment apps and their responses                 | Need to be created manually by custom apps; depends on the app implementation |
| Balances               | Always automatically calculated by Saleor                                                             | In some cases the balances need to be manually calculated by the custom app   |
| Flexibility            | Limited by the set of predefined actions and mutations; designed to handle most of business scenarios | Almost anything is possible                                                   |
