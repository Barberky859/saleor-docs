There are few ways to work with payments in Saleor:

### Payment apps

Payment apps allow to process payments with external payment providers, without communicating with them directly, which is specially convenient for front-end development.

- Using [payment app](/developer/payments/payment-apps.mdx).

- Guide to [building payment apps](/developer/extending/apps/building-payment-app.mdx).

:::note

If you're considering building a custom payment integration, please check if the payment provider you're interested in isn't already available [Saleor App Store](developer/app-store/apps/overview.mdx#built-in-apps-catalog).

### Using plugins included in core

Using payment plugins is similar to using payment apps, with few key differences:

- Payment plugins are included in core, so it is discouraged to modify them.
- Building your own payment plugins is discouraged, and relies on undocumented APIs which will be deprecated.
- Payment plugins are not as flexible as payment apps, and do not support multiple transactions on a single order.

**Should you use payment plugins?**

In case you need to use a payment provider that is not [available as a payment app](developer/app-store/apps/overview.mdx#built-in-apps-catalog), you can use a payment plugin. In case such provider will be available in the future swapping plugin with app would require refactoring of the checkout flow.

### Payment APIs via Backend

Payment apps should cover most of the cases for processing payments, but in some cases you might need to build a custom payment flow or payment related automation logic, in such case your backend can directly interact with transaction objects.

Example of such use case:

- Product Subscriptions, where backend logic is responsible for creating transactions for each subscription period.
- Your app needs to automate refunds based on some business logic.
- Your don't want to route your storefront via Saleor to interact with payment gateway, instead it will work directly with your app.
- Integrating with payment orchestration platforms
