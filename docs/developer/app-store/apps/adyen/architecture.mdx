## Webhook events

The Adyen App implements the following [Saleor sync webhooks related to transactions](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction.mdx):

- [`PAYMENT_GATEWAY_INITIALIZE_SESSION`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumpayment_gateway_initialize_session.mdx)
- [`TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_initialize_session.mdx)
- [`TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_process_session.mdx)
- [`TRANSACTION_CHARGE_REQUESTED`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_charge_requested.mdx)
- [`TRANSACTION_CANCEL_REQUESTED`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_cancelation_requested.mdx)
- [`TRANSACTION_REFUND_REQUESTED`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_refund_requested.mdx)

Furthermore, it's also prepared to handle [async Adyen webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks.mdx).

The Adyen App follows the flow described in detail in the [Saleor Payment App documentation](developer/payments/overview.mdx#payment-app.mdx).

## Limitations

This section contains known limitations of this App.

### Maximum timeout for Adyen calls is 15 seconds

Saleor synchronous webhooks have a maximum response time limit of 20 seconds. The app restricts the Adyen response time to 15 seconds to allow graceful error handling.
If Adyen surpasses this limit, the App will return a FAILURE status with an appropriate error message (Timeout Error).

### Maximum timeout for Saleor API calls is 5 seconds

The app restricts Saleor API response time to 5 seconds for [`TransactionInitializeSession`](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction.mdx#initialize-transaction-session.mdx) and [`TransactionProcessSession`](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction.mdx#process-transaction-session.mdx) subscriptions. If Saleor API surpasses this limit, the App will gracefully continue processing.

If such timeout happens, the created [`TransactionItem`](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-item.mdx) will not have the metadata from Adyen on `additionalDetails` object, which includes payment method type, credit card brand, etc.

### Granted refunds vs manual refunds

There are differences in how refunds are handled depending on wether an [`OrderGrantedRefund`](/api-reference/orders/objects/order-granted-refund.mdx) was created in Saleor and a refund via [`transactionRequestRefundForGrantedRefund`](api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-refund-for-granted-refund.mdx) mutation was requested, or a "manual refund" sent via [`transactionRequestAction`](/api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-action.mdx) mutation was requested. The differences is in how [`lineItems`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/71/post/payments/_paymentPspReference_/refunds#request-lineItems.mdx) are reported to Adyen

#### Manual refund

A manual refund is initiated using the [`transactionRequestAction`](/api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-action.mdx) mutation.

When manual refund is requested, the app will send `lineItems` to Adyen if the `amount` is equal to or greater than Order's total gross amount.
In other cases app will not send `lineItems` to Adyen.

#### Granted refund


 <Badge
   text="Added in Saleor 3.15"
   class="badge badge--secondary margin-bottom--sm"
 />

A granted refund is initiated using the [`transactionRequestRefundForGrantedRefund`](/api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-refund-for-granted-refund.mdx) mutation.

When granted refund is requested, app will map `grantedRefund.lines.orderLines` to `lineItems` reported to Adyen. Additionally, if `grantedRefund.shippingCostIncluded` is set to true, the app will include a shipping line in the lineItems sent to Adyen.

## TransactionItem metadata

App sets metadata on each `TransactionItem` it creates in Saleor. Metadata is set when app receives asynchronous confirmation from Adyen via webhook.

### Configuring fields included in metadata

Adyen app sets fields on metadata from `NotificationItem.additionalData` object it receives from Adyen. To configure which fields are included by Adyen go to `Developres > Additional data` and select your preffered fields.

:::caution
Remember to always include following fields for proper notification handling:
- `Authorization amount`
- `Authorisation amount (dynamic zero authorisation)`
- `Recurring details`
- `Merchant reference`
:::

For example if you want to have data abuot used payment method and it's variant choose:
- `Subvariant`
- `Variant`
- `Co-brand`
- `Expiry date`
- `Card summary`


After choosing these fields you will have following fields set on your `TransactionItem` metadata:

```json
{
  "cardSummary": "1111",
  "expiryDate": "8/2018",
  "paymentMethodVariant": "visadebit",
  "paymentMethod": "visa",
  "coBrandedWith": "visa",
  "authorisedAmountCurrency": "EUR",
  "authorisedAmountValue": "1000",
  "recurring.shopperReference": "testshopper",
  "recurring.recurringDetailReference": "1111111111111111",
  "merchantReference": "ref_1234"
}
```

### Subscribing to metadata changes

The best way to check metadata updates on TransactionItem is to subscribe to [`TRANSACTION_ITEM_METADATA_UPDATED`](/api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-async-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypeasyncenumtransaction_item_metadata_updated) async webhook event. This way you can be sure that metadata is up-to-date in your external system (e.g. if you use metadata to store which payment method was used for tax purposes).

If you include `metafields` or `metadata` from `TransactionItem` in any other subscription it might not be set at all, or be out-of-date.

:::note
For example if you use `ORDER_CREATED` webhook to check `TransactionItem.metadata` then if your customer has completed checkout very quickly, metadata might not yet be set on `TransactionItem`. This means it won't be included in a notification from Saleor.
:::

#### Example

Here's an example subscription query that listens to metadata changes

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    ... on TransactionItemMetadataUpdated {
      __typename
      issuingPrincipal {
        ... on App {
          identifier
        }
      }
      transaction {
        id
        pspReference
        order {
          id
        }
        metafields
      }
    }
  }
}
```
