title: Order status
---

## Introduction

A typical order lifecycle begins with a customer finalizing the checkout process and ends with delivering the products. Between those two points, the order can go through several states. This article describes the possible states of an order and the transitions between them.

## Settings

Several settings can affect the behavior of the order. You can find them in the [`channel.orderSettings`](api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/order-settings.mdx) object.

## Order status

Below is a diagram that shows the possible states of an order and the transitions between them. Names of the states are drawn from the [`OrderStatus`](api-reference/orders/enums/order-status.mdx) enum. Each state is described in detail in the following sections.

The order is initiated either by creating a draft version or completing a checkout.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state if_state_fulfillments <<choice>>
    state if_state_returns <<choice>>
    state if_state_automatic_confirmation <<choice>>

    [*] --> DRAFT: Draft order created

    DRAFT --> UNFULFILLED: Confirmed
    [*] --> if_state_automatic_confirmation: Checkout completed
    if_state_automatic_confirmation --> UNFULFILLED: With automatic confirmation
    if_state_automatic_confirmation --> UNCONFIRMED: Without automatic confirmation


    UNCONFIRMED --> UNFULFILLED: Confirmed
    UNCONFIRMED --> EXPIRED: Expire time overdue
    UNFULFILLED --> if_state_fulfillments: Fulfillment created
    PARTIALLY_FULFILLED --> FULFILLED: All products fulfilled
    if_state_fulfillments --> FULFILLED: All products fulfilled
    if_state_fulfillments --> PARTIALLY_FULFILLED: Subset of products fulfilled
    PARTIALLY_FULFILLED --> if_state_returns: Products returned


    UNFULFILLED --> if_state_returns: Products returned
    FULFILLED --> if_state_returns: Products returned
    PARTIALLY_RETURNED --> RETURNED: All products returned
    if_state_returns --> RETURNED: All products returned
    if_state_returns --> PARTIALLY_RETURNED: Subset of products returned

    UNFULFILLED --> CANCELED: Cancel

    CANCELED --> [*]
    EXPIRED --> [*]
    RETURNED --> [*]
```

### DRAFT

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR

    [*] --> DRAFT: Draft order created in the Dashboard or the API

    DRAFT --> UNFULFILLED: Order confirmed
    DRAFT --> [*]: Draft order removed

```

- Result of [`draftOrderCreate`](api-reference/orders/mutations/draft-order-create.mdx) mutation.
- Item stocks are allocated.

#### Available transitions

- Remove: removed `DRAFT` orders are not visible in the dashboard.
- Finalize: the status will change to `UNFULFILLED`.

### UNCONFIRMED

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR

    [*] --> UNCONFIRMED

    UNCONFIRMED --> UNFULFILLED: Order confirmed
    UNCONFIRMED --> EXPIRED: Expire time has passed
    UNCONFIRMED --> CANCELED: Order canceled

```

- Item stocks are allocated.
- this state is the result of [`checkoutComplete`](api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-complete.mdx) mutation, if [`channel.orderSettings.automaticallyConfirmAllNewOrders`](api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/order-settings.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-ordersettingsbautomaticallyconfirmallnewordersbcodeboolean--) is set to `False`.

#### Available transitions

- Confirm: the status will change to `UNFULFILLED`.
- Expire: the status will automatically change to `EXPIRED` if the order is older than [`channel.orderSettings.expireOrdersAfter`](api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/order-settings.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-ordersettingsbexpireordersafterbcodeminute-) minutes. This will happen automatically only if no transaction attempts were made.
- Cancel: the status will change to `CANCELED` and order will be visible in the dashboard.

### UNFULFILLED

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state if_state_fulfillments <<choice>>
    state if_state_returns <<choice>>

    direction LR

    [*] --> UNFULFILLED

    UNFULFILLED --> if_state_fulfillments: Fulfillment created
    if_state_fulfillments --> FULFILLED: All products fulfilled
    if_state_fulfillments --> PARTIALLY_FULFILLED: Products waiting for fulfillment

    UNFULFILLED --> CANCELED: Order canceled

    UNFULFILLED --> if_state_returns: Return items
    if_state_returns --> RETURNED: All products returned
    if_state_returns --> PARTIALLY_RETURNED: Not all products returned

```

- Item stocks are allocated.
- Result of [`orderConfirm`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-confirm.mdx) mutation or finishing a checkout in a channel with automatic confirmation.

#### Available transitions

- Fulfill: creating fulfillments will result in transition to `PARTIALLY_FULFILLED` or `FULFILLED` state, depending on whether there are any unfulfilled items left. This will also deduct stock quantity from warehouses and release allocations.
- Return: creating returns will result in transition to `PARTIALLY_RETURNED` or `RETURNED` state.
- Cancel: the status will change to `CANCELED` and order will be visible in the dashboard.

### PARTIALLY_FULFILLED

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR

    [*] --> PARTIALLY_FULFILLED
    state if_state_fulfillments <<choice>>
    state if_state_returns <<choice>>


    PARTIALLY_FULFILLED --> if_state_fulfillments: Fulfillment created
    if_state_fulfillments --> PARTIALLY_FULFILLED: Products waiting for fulfillment
    if_state_fulfillments --> FULFILLED: All products fulfilled

    PARTIALLY_FULFILLED --> if_state_returns: Return items
    if_state_returns --> PARTIALLY_RETURNED: Not all products returned
    if_state_returns --> RETURNED: All products returned
```

- Stocks of unfulfilled items are allocated, and fulfilled items are deducted from the stock quantity.
- Result of [`orderFulfill`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-fulfill.mdx) mutation.

#### Available actions

- Fulfill: creating fulfillments will result in transition to `PARTIALLY_FULFILLED` or `FULFILLED` state, depending on whether there are any unfulfilled items left. This will also deduct stock quantity from warehouses and release allocations.
- Return: creating returns will result in transition to `PARTIALLY_RETURNED` or `RETURNED` state.

### FULFILLED

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR

    [*] --> FULFILLED
    state if_state_returns <<choice>>

    FULFILLED --> if_state_returns: Return items
    if_state_returns --> PARTIALLY_RETURNED: Not all products returned
    if_state_returns --> RETURNED: All products returned


```

- No allocations, stocks already deducted from warehouses.
- Result of [`orderFulfill`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-fulfill.mdx) mutation.
- Purpose: order is fulfilled, waiting for optional operations: return, refund.

### PARTIALLY_RETURNED

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR

    [*] --> PARTIALLY_RETURNED

    state if_state_returns <<choice>>

    PARTIALLY_RETURNED --> if_state_returns: Return items
    if_state_returns --> PARTIALLY_RETURNED: Not all products returned
    if_state_returns --> RETURNED: All products returned

```

- Some of the items were marked as returned.
- Return procedure does not modify stocks automatically.

### RETURNED

- All of the items were marked as returned.

### EXPIRED

- Stock allocations are released.
- It will happen automatically based on channel settings.

#### Available actions

This state cannot be changed.

### CANCELED

- Stock allocations are released.
- Result of [`orderCancel`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-cancel.mdx).
- Possible previous states: UNCONFIRMED, UNFULFILLED.

#### Available actions

## Payment status

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR

    PENDING
    REFUSED
    CANCELED
    NOT_CHARGED
    PARTIALLY_CHARGED
    FULLY_CHARGED
    PARTIALLY_REFUNDED
    FULLY_REFUNDED

    PENDING --> REFUSED
    PENDING --> CANCELED
    PENDING --> NOT_CHARGED

    NOT_CHARGED --> PARTIALLY_CHARGED
    NOT_CHARGED --> FULLY_CHARGED
    PARTIALLY_CHARGED --> FULLY_CHARGED

    PENDING --> PARTIALLY_CHARGED
    PENDING --> FULLY_CHARGED

    FULLY_CHARGED --> PARTIALLY_REFUNDED
    FULLY_CHARGED --> FULLY_REFUNDED
    PARTIALLY_REFUNDED --> FULLY_REFUNDED

    PARTIALLY_REFUNDED --> FULLY_REFUNDED
```

[Payment status](api-reference/orders/objects/order.mdx#orderpaymentstatuspaymentchargestatusenum--) represents the combined payment and refund status of the order. It's calculated based on:

- `order.total` value
- status of the payments
- refunds granted for the order

When no refunds is created, the status is one of the following:

- `PENDING`: waiting for the response from the payment gateway
- `REFUSED`: payment refused by the payment gateway
- `CANCELED`: payment has been canceled
- `NOT_CHARGED`: the amount is authorized but not charged
- `PARTIALLY_CHARGED`: the charged amount does not cover the order total
- `FULLY_CHARGED`: charged funds fully cover the order total

Creating the refund will change the status to:

- `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`: the refunded amount does not cover the order total
- `FULLY_REFUNDED`: refunded funds fully cover the order total

## Authorize status

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR

    NONE --> PARTIAL
    NONE --> FULL
    FULL --> PARTIAL
    PARTIAL --> FULL

```

TODO: explain what it is

Charge status depends on:

- the sum of **charged** transactions
- the sum of **authorized** transactions
- the `order.totalGrantedRefund` value
- the `order.total` value

The difference between `total` and `totalGrantedRefund` is compared with the sum of **charged** and **authorized** transactions. The result is one of the statuses: `PARTIAL`, `FULL`. If no transaction has been charged, the status is `NONE`.

### Available transitions

- Status is updated on operations that change the order's `total`, `totalGrantedRefund` or transactions

## Charge status

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2

    NONE --> PARTIAL
    NONE --> FULL
    NONE --> OVERCHARGED

    PARTIAL --> FULL

    OVERCHARGED --> PARTIAL


    FULL --> OVERCHARGED
    FULL --> PARTIAL
```

TODO: explain what it is

Charge status depends on:

- the sum of **charged** transactions
- the `order.totalGrantedRefund` value
- the `order.total` value

The difference between `total` and `totalGrantedRefund` is compared with **charged** transactions and the result is one of the statuses: `PARTIAL`, `FULL`, `OVERCHARGED`. If no transaction has been charged, the status is `NONE`.

### Available transitions

- Status is updated on operations that change the order's `total`, `totalGrantedRefund` or transactions
